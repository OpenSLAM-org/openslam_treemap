# IMAGE <width> <height>
IMAGE 640 480

# REFLIGHT <refLight>
# Which amount of (floating point) light is mapped to full image intensity
# usually about 0.001.
REFLIGHT 0.001

# CENTER <x> <y>
# The camera rotates about (x, y, 0) and the colors are mapped in 4 sectors
# which intersect in the center.
CENTER 175 -175

# ROTATION <radius> <w>
# The camera rotates about the center with a radius of <radius> and an
# angular velocity of <w>
ROTATION 185 0.007

# CUT <t> <v> <z>
# Defines when to go how fast through the sequence of images
# There are several lines possible and the parameter are interpolated
# according to <t> between consecutive lines. <v> defines the amount
# by which <t> is increased with each rendered image. <z> defines the
# height of the camera. Don't use v=0.
